'''PEOPLE'S INITIATIVE FOR TECHNOLOGY'''

A '''[[COVID-19 pandemic in India|COVID-19]]''' Emergency Tech Support Initiative by Few Students and Research Scholars of [[Jadavpur University|JADAVPUR UNIVERSITY]], in Collaboration with Centre for Development of Appropriate Social Technology<ref>http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/upload_files/scroll_info/1586238603.pdf</ref>, Jadavpur University.

== '''PIT's WORK TILL NOW:''' ==
In view of the COVID-19 pandemic, we observed that statistical data from across the globe shows comparatively flattened community spread curves with higher use of masks by lower spread of [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS COV-2]]. With the initial help of CAST, JU, we designed a three-layered <ref>http://164.100.117.97/WriteReadData/userfiles/FINAL%20MASK%20MANUAL.pdf</ref>, multiple use, low-cost [[Surgical mask|Mask]]. We started production and we have already distributed more than 9000 masks across West Bengal. We realise that this is a humble start, but we have only just started. We plan on undertaking more such ventures, while continuing and upscaling our continuing work.
<br>
== '''OBSERVATIONS WHILE WORKING:''' ==
In the short span of work, they have come across the terrible living and working conditions of the industrial, agricultural and medical workers. Unfortunately,the state turns itâ€™s eyes away from the ones who turn the wheels of society. This brought us to the realization that we must adopt a year-long program to ideate and innovate technology and bring them to the workers.
<br>
== '''VISION:''' ==
We realise that the priviledges we hold and the luxuries we enjoy is produced by the society as a whole and hence, it is our responsibility to give something back to the society. We believe that Jadavpur University has some brilliant minds who are capable, and hold critical thinking capacity to Ideate , Innovate & Build sustainable technology solutions which can be implemented in the places which need it the most.<br>
